Hello,

I encountered an issue with the following code:
```php
echo Carbon::parse('2018-06-01')->subDay()->month;
```

Carbon version: **PUT HERE YOUR CARBON VERSION (exact version, not the range)**

PHP version: **PUT HERE YOUR PHP VERSION**

<!--
    Run the command `composer show nesbot/carbon`
    to get "versions"
    Use `echo phpversion();`
    to get PHP version.

    Some issues can depends on your context, settings,
    macros, timezone, language. So to be sure the code

I expected to get:

```

    Always give your expectations. Each use has their owns.
    You may want daylight saving time to be taken into account,
    someone else want it to be ignored. You may want timezone
    to be used in comparisons, someone else may not, etc.
-->

But I actually get:

```
5
```
<!--
