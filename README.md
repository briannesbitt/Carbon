## How it works?

We use [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static generator in Ruby, to create this website.

## First Steps

1 - Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/pt/downloads/), in case you don't have them yet.

2 - Once installed these dependecies, open up the terminal and install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with the following commands.

```sh
$ gem install jekyll
```

3 - Now clone the project
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:briannesbitt/Carbon.git
```

4 - Navigate to the project folder
```sh
$ cd Carbon
```

5 - And finally run: 
```sh
$ jekyll server --watch
```

You'll have access to the website at `localhost:4000` :D

## File Structure

The file structure for the project is organized in the following way:

```
.
|-- _includes
|-- _layouts
|-- _posts
|-- _config.yml
`-- index.html
```

### [_includes](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon/tree/gh-pages/_includes)

They're blocks of code used to generate the main page of the site (index.html).

### [_layouts](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon/tree/gh-pages/_layouts)

Here you'll find the default template of the application.

### [_posts](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon/tree/gh-pages/_posts)

Here you'll find a list of files for each post.

### [_config.yml](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon/_config.yml)

It stores most of the settings of the application.

### [index.html](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon/index.html)

It's the file responsible for all application sections.
