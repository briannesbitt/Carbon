Please report any security issue using [Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security).
Tidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure.
Please don't disclose security bugs publicly until they have been handled by us.

For any other bug or issue, please click this link and follow the template:

You may think this template does not apply to your case but please think again. A long description will never be as
clear as a code chunk with the output you expect from it (for either bug report or new features).
